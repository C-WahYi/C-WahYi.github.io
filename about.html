                        Since young, I have a passion for helping people. I feel fufilled when I am
                        able to help and enrich other people's lives. Its a joy to be able to bring
                        smiles to other people. I have been serving and volunteering since 2014 and I
                        do not plan to stop anytime soon. Below are some organisations that I have 
                        volunteered for.

                        I have been volunteering with them since 2014, from them I have learnt on how
                        to care for others and be able to serve with an open heart. I love their way
                        of caring for others. They treat everyone with kindness and respect.

                        People's Association Grassroots Leaders<br>
                        I have been volunteering with People's Association for a shorter amount of time,
                        since 2019. They serve the wider community, the young, the old and in between.
                        Being able to volunteer alongside them helped me to empathise with the needs of
                        other residents. Recently, since Jan 2023 until now, have been the secretary for
                        my area's resident network. It has been fufilling work, to be able to give back
                        and serve the place that I live in.

                        Other than Volunteering, I like to go bowling when I have time to rest and relax.
                        I like bowling, its a sport of being focus and tranquil. To have a calm mind and
                        to perform each motion with consistency and routine, that is what draws me
                        to bowling. The fun part is trying to do the same thing repeatedly, but getting
                        slightly different results each time. Its a fascinating sport to pick up!
