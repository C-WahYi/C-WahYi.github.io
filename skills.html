                        When carying out group projects, I would be facilitating discussions,
                        contributing any ideas that might be relevant to the task at hand. Then,
                        when carrying out the projects I would be proactive to look out for my
                        group mates and offer help when necessary. Through my actions, the group
                        was able to stay on top of our agreed upon deadlines.

                        During discussions for group projects, some of our group mates would have
                        difficulty in understanding the scope and objectives. I would help out and
                        translate the goals in a way that my group mates would understand clearly.
                        On top of that, I think a big part of being a person who can communicate
                        well is the ability to listen. I would practise active listening, repeating
                        what I think are the key points back to them to get a confirmation that we
                        are on the same page. I would also nod and "mhhm" occasionally to let the
                        other party know that I am payinfg attention to the person.

                        To be honest here, I have had good role models in lif me, and it is a
                        reassuring feeling to have. I would love to give comfort te, showing me that
                        having compassion and putting yourself in other people's shoes are very
                        important in life. I too have had people empathise with others as it
                        sucks to feel alone.
