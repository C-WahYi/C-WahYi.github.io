                    This calculator project was quite fun for me to do. It was done in Kotlin language and it was my first
                    project on android studio. I have picked up on how to merge xml and the kotlin side of things for them
                    to communicate.

                <h3>
                    This website has been so fun to make. I spent quite a bit of time on debugging the website, it was build 
                    from scratch. In making this website, W3Schools and Youtube were two resources that I referenced with the
                    most.I picked out what I wanted and how to incooperate it into my projectlike the navbar, side and main 
                    split of the screen.<br> Here are some parts of the website that I think are pretty cool:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Side bar is sticky and follows the screen</li>
                        <li>Headers have an id so the side bar buttons can scroll to the headers</li>
                        <li>In every screen at the bottom right hand corner there is a scroll to top button</li>
                        <li>Having a picture scoll in the "About Me" section with Javascript inserted</li>
                        <li>Repeating Gifs in the website</li>
                        <li>Solving the problem on how to equally section out parts of the table in the "Credits" part of the 
                            website. The images in the "Credits" section being able to resize according to the window's size is
                            also pretty cool.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
